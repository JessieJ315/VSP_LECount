# VSP_LECount

Python version of the count the linear extensions in the vertex-series-parallel order. 

- partial_order_func.py: includes functions on general partial orders.
- vsp_func.py: defines the binary decomposition tree (BDT) class and functions to operate on BDTs (each represents a vertex-series-parallel partial order (VSP)).

The main function is nle_tree() in vsp_func.py that counts the number of linear extension of a VSP represented by a BDT.
